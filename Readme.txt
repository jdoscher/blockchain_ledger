Directions:
Take a look at the sample cells where you can replace your own cryptocurrency and amount.  Look at the control panel tab for some sample values such as conversion to USD, etc.

Be very careful about doing bulk updates that look up the crypto values- it will look like the spreadsheet is locking up, but it's just looking up the values one at a time.  Because of this, it's a little slow going adding past transactions, but as you only add one line at a time going forward, it should work just fine.

The macro code is required for the API lookup to work.  It's a fairly simple function, so no nastiness embedded.  I hope the community finds this useful!
